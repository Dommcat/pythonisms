This project demonstrates some key Pythonic features including custom collections using iterators/generators, decorators, and the usage of dunder methods to make the code more readable and elegant.

## Features

* **Iterators/Generators:** MyCollection class uses iterators and generators making it iterable.
* **Decorators:** The project includes a time_decorator that logs the time taken by a function.
* **Dunder Methods:** The MyDataStructure class uses the `__eq__` and `__bool__` dunder methods to check for equality and truthiness respectively.

## Test: 

run requiremtns.txt
